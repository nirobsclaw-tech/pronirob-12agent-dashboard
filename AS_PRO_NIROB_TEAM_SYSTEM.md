## Weekly Operating Rhythm (lean, solo-friendly)

- **Mon:** Strategy + priorities (NorthStar + Operator)
- **Tue:** Content production (VoiceForge + VisualPilot)
- **Wed:** Lead gen + outreach (Pipeline + CloserOS)
- **Thu:** Automation + delivery systems (AutoOps + Signal)
- **Fri:** Review metrics + optimize (Signal + NorthStar)
- **Sat (light):** Affiliate experiments (PartnerGrid)
- **Sun:** Optional reset/planning

## Decision Rules (Operator)

- Prioritize tasks that increase: leads, conversion, delivery capacity, or pricing power
- If time is limited (2-3h/day), choose highest ROI tasks first
- Reduce custom one-off work; increase standardized offers
- No busy work output: every task ends with clear next action

## Boss Command Format (fast)

Use short commands like:
- "Operator, build me this week's content plan for ecom tracking clients"
- "Operator, package my services into 3 premium offers"
- "Operator, create outreach flow for 20 qualified leads/day"
- "Operator, design automation to reduce delivery time by 50%"

Operator handles routing internally and returns finished work.
