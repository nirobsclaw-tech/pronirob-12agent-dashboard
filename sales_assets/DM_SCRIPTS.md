# DM/WhatsApp Sales Scripts

## Script A - Cold Outreach (First Message)
```
Hey [Name], quick note — a lot of ecommerce stores are losing conversion signal between Meta, GA4, and server events. 

I run a Tracking Clarity Check that shows exactly what's broken and what to fix first. 

Want me to send the 10-point check?
```

## Script B - WhatsApp Follow-up (After Interest)
```
Awesome. Based on your setup + ad spend, I can suggest the best-fit fix tier so you don't overspend. 

Share: 
1. website
2. monthly ad spend range  
3. Meta/Google (or both)

Then I'll send exact next steps.
```

## Script C - Follow-up (48 hours)
```
Quick follow-up, [Name] — if tracking is even slightly off, optimization decisions become expensive. 

I can do a fast audit and give you the top 3 highest-impact fixes first. 

Want me to send available slots?
```

## Script D - Call Close
```
Your setup is usable, but not decision-grade yet. 

I can fully fix this in [X days] so your ad data becomes reliable. 

Want me to send the implementation scope + start plan?
```

## Script E - Value Positioning
```
Many brands think their ads are underperforming when really their tracking is broken.

Last week I fixed a Shopify store's Meta pixel and their conversion rate went from 2.1% to 3.8% just from better attribution data.

Want me to show you what I'm seeing in your tracking setup?
```

## Usage Tips
