> 
> Let me ask you this...
> 
> **How much revenue are you okay with leaving on the table every month?**
> 
> For most stores, the answer is "zero" - but they're losing thousands anyway.
> 
> More about that in tomorrow's email 👇

#### Email 2: Case Study *(Day 3)*
**Subject**: How we recovered $287k for TechGear Plus (case study)

**Content Preview**:
> Hi [First Name],
> 
> Remember yesterday I mentioned that most stores have 3-5 major revenue leaks they're unaware of?
> 
> Let me show you exactly what that looks like in the real world...
> 
> **Client**: TechGear Plus ($1.2M annual revenue)
> **Industry**: Tech accessories
> **Challenge**: Massive revenue leaks they couldn't see
> 
> **What we found in their tracking audit:**
> - 73% of conversions were untracked
> - $43k monthly spend on ads was driving "ghost" traffic
> - Cart abandonment tracking was completely broken
> - Customer journey mapping was missing 4 major touchpoints
> 
> **The result?** They were losing an estimated $187,000 annually just from tracking issues alone.
> 
> After we fixed their tracking and implemented our revenue recovery system, they recovered $287,000 in year one.
> 
> Here's the kicker: **It took us only 48 hours to identify the problem.**
> 
> But the real question is... what's happening in YOUR store?
> 
> **Do you know:**
> - Exactly how many sales you're losing to tracking errors?
> - Which ad channels are actually profitable?
> - Where customers drop off in your checkout process?
> - How much you're spending on "ghost" traffic?
> 
> If you answered "no" to any of these questions, you're leaving money on the table.
> 
> Want to find YOUR hidden revenue leaks?
> 
> [Get Your Free Revenue Recovery Analysis]

#### Email 3: Educational Content *(Day 5)*
**Subject**: The #1 reason stores lose 60-80% of their conversion data

**Content Preview**:
> Hi [First Name],
> 
> In our last two emails, we've talked about revenue leaks and shown you a real case study.
> 
> Today I want to explain WHY this happens so often - because the root cause might surprise you.
> 
> **The #1 Reason Ecommerce Stores Lose Conversion Data:**
> 
> **Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Migration Issues**
> 
> If you migrated from Universal Analytics (UA) to GA4 before July 2024, there's a 67% chance your ecommerce tracking is broken.
> 
> **Here's what typically goes wrong:**
> - Enhanced ecommerce events aren't firing
> - Purchase conversion tracking is incomplete
> - Attribution models are set up incorrectly
> - Cross-domain tracking is broken
> - Custom events weren't transferred properly
> 
> **The result?** You're flying blind on 60-80% of your actual sales data.
> 
> **Real example:** Last week we audited a fashion store that thought they had a "poor conversion rate" of 1.2%. Their actual conversion rate was 3.8% - but GA4 was only tracking 31% of conversions.
> 
> They went from "our store converts poorly" to "we need more inventory" overnight.
> 
> **Signs your GA4 tracking might be broken:**
> - Conversion rates seem unusually low
> - Your ecommerce reports show incomplete data
> - Ad spend looks unprofitable when you know it's working
> - Revenue numbers don't match your payment processor
> 
> **Want to check if your GA4 tracking is working correctly?**
> 
> I've created a quick GA4 health check tool that takes 2 minutes to complete.
> 
> [Check My GA4 Tracking Health - Free Tool]
> 
> It will immediately tell you if your tracking is working properly.
> 
> Tomorrow, I'll share the story of how we helped a store recover $445,000 in just 8 months...
> 
> To your success,
> Pro Nirob
