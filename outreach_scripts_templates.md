### Email 1: Problem Identification
```
Subject: {{company_name}} - Your {{loss_percentage}}% revenue is invisible to Google Analytics

Hi {{first_name}},

I was reviewing {{company_name}}'s website and noticed something that might be costing you significant revenue. Your {{specific_metric}} shows visitors completing purchases, but Google Analytics isn't properly tracking {{tracking_gap}}.

This means Google and Facebook algorithms are working with incomplete data, potentially reducing your ad performance by {{estimated_loss}}%.

Most Shopify stores like yours are missing 15-25% of conversions due to tracking gaps that are completely fixable in under 48 hours.

Want to see exactly what you're missing?

### Email 2: Case Study/Proof
```
Subject: How {{similar_company}} recovered $47K in lost revenue

Hi {{first_name}},

Remember the tracking issue I mentioned with {{company_name}}?

Just helped a similar {{industry}} store ({{similar_company}}) recover $47,000 in lost ad attribution over the past 3 months. The issue? Their checkout process wasn't properly passing conversion data to Facebook and Google.

Here's what we found:
• 23% of purchases weren't being attributed to ads
• Facebook's algorithm was optimizing for wrong conversion events  
• Google Analytics showed 40% fewer conversions than actual sales

The fix took 36 hours and has already generated 3.2x ROI in the first month.

Sound like it might be worth a quick look at {{company_name}}?

P.S. - The audit takes about 5 minutes and I'll show you exactly what's bleeding through the cracks.
```

### Email 3: Social Proof & Urgency
```
Subject: Last chance - Google Analytics 4 changes impact your tracking

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick heads up: Google's recent GA4 updates are causing tracking failures for e-commerce sites that don't have the latest implementation.

{{company_name}} might be affected if:
✓ You launched ads after October 2024
✓ You recently changed checkout providers  
✓ You're running multi-channel campaigns

I caught this same issue with {{case_study_company}} last week - they were losing $2,300/month in untracked conversions.

The good news: it's completely fixable in 24-48 hours.

Want me to run a quick audit to see if you're affected?

### Email 4: Value Stacking
```
Subject: What you're leaving on the table with incomplete tracking

Hi {{first_name}},

Let's put numbers to this:

If {{company_name}} is spending $5,000/month on ads (conservative estimate), and tracking gaps are causing 18% attribution loss:
• Monthly loss: $900 in untracked conversions
• Annual loss: $10,800 in invisible revenue
• Plus: 18% reduction in ad algorithm performance

Compare that to a $299 tracking fix that takes 48 hours to implement.

The ROI is pretty clear, but I understand you need to see what's actually happening first.

Can I run a 5-minute audit to show you the exact numbers for {{company_name}}?

### Email 5: Final Follow-up
```
Subject: Quick question about {{company_name}}'s tracking

Hi {{first_name}},

One last check - are you currently tracking customer journeys across all touchpoints (site → checkout → purchase) in your analytics?

If not, you're likely missing significant revenue attribution.

Worth a 5-minute conversation to see what you're leaving on the table?

### Initial WhatsApp Message
```
Hi {{first_name}}! 👋

Saw your ads for {{company_name}} - impressive growth on {{platform}}! 

Quick question: are you currently tracking all your customer journeys in GA4? Most Shopify stores miss 15-25% of conversions due to tracking gaps.

If you want a free 5-minute analysis of what's potentially invisible to your ads, I'm happy to help.

### Follow-up WhatsApp (Day 3)
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my message about tracking optimization. 

I helped a similar {{industry}} store recover $X in lost ad attribution last month. The free audit takes about 5 minutes and shows exactly what's bleeding through the cracks.

Worth a quick look? 

Can do it right now if you have 2 minutes.
```

### Value-First WhatsApp
```
{{first_name}}, wanted to share something that might help:

Common Shopify tracking gap: purchases recorded but without source attribution. This tells FB/Google "no ad = better converter" and reduces your ad delivery by 15-30%.

Free 2-minute check if you're curious to see your version of this.
```

### Direct Value WhatsApp
```
{{first_name}}, just finished an audit for a {{industry}} store similar to {{company_name}}. Found $3,200/month in untracked conversions (18% of their revenue).

Took 36 hours to fix. Already seeing 2.1x improvement in ad performance.

Worth checking if {{company_name}} has similar gaps?
```

## 🎯 Discovery Call Script

### Opening (2 minutes)
```
"Thanks for taking the time to speak with me. Before we dive in, I want to make sure this is worth your time.

You mentioned you're running into tracking issues with {{company_name}}. Can you walk me through what's been happening?

[Listen for: specific pain points, current setup, urgency level]"

"What I'm hoping to do today is show you exactly what might be causing revenue leakage and whether our Tracking Recovery System is the right fit for {{company_name}}.

Sound good?"
```

### Problem Exploration (10 minutes)
```
"Walk me through your current setup:
• What analytics are you using? (GA4, Facebook Analytics, etc.)
• How are you currently tracking conversions?
• What ad platforms are you running?
• Have you noticed any discrepancies between what you're selling and what your analytics show?

[Take notes, ask follow-up questions]

The most common issues I see with stores like yours are:
• Checkout process not passing conversion data
• Multi-touch attribution gaps  
• Cross-platform tracking failures

Does any of this sound familiar?"
```

### Solution Preview (8 minutes)
```
"Based on what you've described, it sounds like {{company_name}} could benefit from our Tracking Recovery System. Here's how it works:

**Our Process:**
1. Complete audit of your current tracking setup (2-3 hours)
2. Identify specific gaps causing revenue leakage (typically 15-25% of conversions)
3. Implement fixes for GA4, Facebook Pixel, Google Ads, and checkout tracking (24-48 hours)
4. Validate that all conversions are properly attributed
5. Provide reporting showing recovered attribution

**Timeline:** Complete implementation within 48 hours
**Investment:** ${{pricing_tier}} for the full system
**Expected Outcome:** 15-30% improvement in ad algorithm performance + accurate attribution

Does this align with what {{company_name}} needs?"
```

### Objection Handling (5 minutes)
```
COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES:

"I'm not sure we have budget right now"
"I understand budget constraints. Can I ask - if you're currently spending $X on ads and losing 18% of that in untracked conversions, what's that costing you monthly? [Wait for response] That's exactly what we'd recover."

"We have an agency handling this"
"Great that you're working with an agency. Many of my best clients came from agencies that specialize in campaigns but don't have deep tracking expertise. We can work alongside them or provide the technical implementation they might be missing."

"We just need to figure this out ourselves"
"I completely understand wanting to handle it internally. Just so you know, most stores spend 20-40 hours debugging tracking issues internally. Our system is designed to get you results in 48 hours instead of weeks."

"The timing isn't right"
"I get it. Just to be clear, every month of incomplete tracking is lost revenue that doesn't come back. But you're the expert on {{company_name}}'s priorities. When would be the right time to revisit this?"
```

### Closing (5 minutes)
```
"Based on our conversation, it sounds like {{company_name}} has some clear tracking gaps that are likely costing you significant revenue. 

Our Tracking Recovery System would:
• Fix the attribution issues we identified
• Restore the missing conversion tracking  
• Improve your ad algorithm performance
• Give you accurate reporting on what's actually working

Investment: ${{pricing_tier}} with 48-hour implementation.

If you decide to move forward, I can start the audit today and have your tracking fully optimized by [specific date].

What questions do you have?"

[Address final questions]

"Great. So if you're ready to recover that missing revenue for {{company_name}}, let's get started. I can begin the audit immediately and have your implementation scheduled for [specific date].

Should I send over the onboarding information?"
