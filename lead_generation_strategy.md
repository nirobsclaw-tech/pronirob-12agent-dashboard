Hi [Name]! 👋

Saw your ads for [Company Name] - impressive growth! 

Quick question: are you currently tracking all your customer journeys in GA4? Most Shopify stores miss 15-25% of conversions due to tracking gaps.

If you want a free 5-minute analysis of what's potentially invisible to your ads, I'm happy to help.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

#### Follow-up Message:
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my message about tracking optimization. 

I helped [Similar Company] recover $X in lost ad attribution last month. The free audit takes about 5 minutes and shows exactly what's bleeding through the cracks.

Worth a quick look? 

Can do it right now if you have 2 minutes.
```

#### Value-First Message:
```
[Name], wanted to share something that might help:

Common Shopify tracking gap: purchases recorded but without source attribution. This tells FB/Google "no ad = better converter" and reduces your ad delivery.

Free 2-minute check if you're curious to see your version of this.
