- `openclaw gateway status`: Check runtime status.
- `openclaw gateway uninstall`: Remove service.

## Updating and Rollback
- Update CLI: `openclaw update`
- If rollback is needed, reinstall pinned version using the official package path described in docs.
- Re-run `openclaw doctor` after updates.

## Uninstall
- Use `openclaw uninstall` for full removal flow.
- Confirm whether state data should be preserved or removed.
